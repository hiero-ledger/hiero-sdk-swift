/// # Smart Contract Create
///
/// Create a new smart contract.
///
/// ## General Comments
///  - A smart contract normally enforces rules, so "the code is law".<br/>
///    For example, an ERC-20 contract prevents a transfer from being undone
///    without a signature by the recipient of the transfer. This characteristic
///    is generally true if the contract instance was created without a value
///    for the `adminKey` field. For some uses, however, it may be desirable to
///    create something like an ERC-20 contract that has a specific group of
///    trusted individuals who can act as a "supreme court" with the ability to
///    override the normal operation, when a sufficient number of them agree to
///    do so. If `adminKey` is set to a valid Key (which MAY be complex), then a
///    transaction that can change the state of the smart contract in arbitrary
///    ways MAY be signed with enough signatures to activate that Key. Such
///    transactions might reverse a transaction, change the code to close an
///    unexpected loophole, remove an exploit, or adjust outputs in ways not
///    covered by the code itself. The admin key MAY also be used to change the
///    autoRenewPeriod, and change the adminKey field itself (for example, to
///    remove that key after a suitable testing period). The API currently does
///    not implement all relevant capabilities. But it does allow the `adminKey`
///    field to be set and queried, and MAY implement further administrative
///    capability in future releases.
///  - The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and
///    creates everything in shard 0 and realm 0. Future versions of the system
///    MAY support additional shards and realms.
///
/// ### Keywords
/// The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
/// "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
/// document are to be interpreted as described in
/// [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
/// [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
