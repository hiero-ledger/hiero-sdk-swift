# Good First Issue — Candidate  
**Hiero Swift SDK (`hiero-sdk-swift`)**

## How to Use This Document

This guide is here to support maintainers and issue creators who use the  
**`good first issue: candidate`** label.

It offers shared language and guidance to help:

**Issue creators:**
- Flag issues that *might* be a great starting point  
- Identify where a little more clarity could help  
- Prepare issues for new contributors  

**Maintainers:**
- Keep the Good First Issue label clear and helpful  
- Give issues time to be refined before promotion  

This isn't a rulebook, and it's not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.  
All contributions are valuable — this label simply helps make the first experience smoother.

## What the Candidate Label Is For

The **`good first issue: candidate`** label is a simple way to mark issues that *might* be a great starting point for new contributors, but could benefit from a little more clarity or polish first.

It gives maintainers space to refine the issue before promoting it as a full **Good First Issue** — helping first-time contributors have the smoothest possible experience.

---

## Why This Label Exists

Some issues look small and approachable, but may still need:

- Clearer instructions  
- More specific file paths  
- Better-defined acceptance criteria  
- A more obvious "next step"  

The candidate label helps signal:  
"This is close — it just needs a little more detail."

---

## How It Helps Contributors

When an issue becomes a Good First Issue, the goal is for contributors to feel:

- Confident about what to do  
- Comfortable jumping in  
- Supported by clear, step-by-step guidance  

The candidate stage is simply a way to make sure the issue is ready to offer that kind of experience.

---

## When the Candidate Label Is Useful

The label can be helpful when:

- The task seems beginner-friendly  
- But some details are still missing  
- Or the implementation steps aren't fully clear yet  

It's a friendly "this is almost ready" marker — not a judgment on the issue or the person who created it.

---

## What Candidate Issues Might Look Like

At this stage, an issue might include:

- Notes for maintainers to clarify later  
- Rough acceptance criteria  
- "We should probably…" ideas  
- Partial instructions  

That's totally okay — the goal is simply to turn those into clear, contributor-friendly steps over time.

---

## A Note on Good First Issue Fit

GitHub promotes **Good First Issues** as a starting point for people new to open source.

That usually works best for tasks that don't require:

- Exploration  
- Design choices  
- Debugging  
- Or deeper system knowledge  

Those kinds of tasks are still valuable — they're just often a better fit for  
**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** labels.

---

## Moving from Candidate → Good First Issue

When an issue feels:

- Clear  
- Well-scoped  
- Easy to follow  
- And friendly for first-time contributors  

It can be promoted to a **Good First Issue**.

There's no rush — taking the time to make an issue welcoming is part of what makes the community stronger.

## The Big Picture

The **Good First Issue — Candidate** label helps make the Hiero Swift SDK friendly for *everyone* — especially new contributors.

All contributions are welcome.  
This label simply helps highlight the easiest place to begin.
