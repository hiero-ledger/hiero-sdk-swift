/// # Token Associate
/// Transaction to associate an Hedera Token Service (HTS) token with an
/// account.<br/>
/// Accounts cannot transact in a token (send or receive) until the account
/// and token are associated.
///
/// > Note
/// >> An "airdrop" transaction MAY initiate sending tokens to an
/// >> unassociated account, but the transfer remains in a "pending"
/// >> state until the recipient executes a "claim" transaction
/// >> that both accepts the tokens and associates that account
/// >> with the token type.
