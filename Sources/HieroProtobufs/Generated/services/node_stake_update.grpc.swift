/// # Node Stake Updates
/// A system-initiated (i.e. internal) transaction to update stake information
/// for nodes at the end of a staking period.
///
/// Note that staking rewards are not paid immediately. The rewards are
/// calculated, and the amount to be paid is reserved in the reward account,
/// at the end of each staking period. The actual recipient accounts are then
/// paid rewards when that account participates in any transaction that
/// changes staking information or the account balance. This reduces the
/// resources for calculating the staking rewards, quite dramatically,
/// and provides an incentive for account owners to engage with the network,
/// in at least a minor fashion, occasionally (typically annually).<br/>
/// The unexpected change in balances, however, can be surprising to the
/// account holder.
///
/// ### Keywords
/// The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
/// "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
/// document are to be interpreted as described in
/// [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
/// [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
