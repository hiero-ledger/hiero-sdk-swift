/// # Crypto Get Account Records
/// Messages for a query to retrieve recent transaction records involving a
/// specified account as effective `payer`.<br/>
/// A "recent" transaction is typically one that reached consensus within
/// the previous three(`3`) minutes of _consensus_ time. Additionally, the
/// network only stores records in state when
/// `ledger.keepRecordsInState=true` was true during transaction handling.
///
/// ### Keywords
/// The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
/// "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
/// document are to be interpreted as described in
/// [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
/// [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
