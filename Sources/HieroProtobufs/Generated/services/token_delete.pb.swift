/// Mark a token as deleted.<br/>
/// A deleted token remains present in the network state, but is no longer
/// active, cannot be held in a balance, and all operations on that token
/// fail. A deleted token is removed from network state when it expires.
///
/// #### Operations on a deleted token
/// All operations on a deleted token SHALL fail with a
/// status code `TOKEN_WAS_DELETED`.<br/>
/// Any attempt to transfer a deleted token between accounts SHALL fail with
/// a status code `TOKEN_WAS_DELETED`.
///
/// > QUESTIONS
/// >> What happens to existing balances/NFTs?
/// >> Are these removed; are they stuck on the accounts?
/// >
/// >> If balances/NFTs remain, can a `tokenReject` remove them?

/// #### Requirements
/// The `admin_key` for the token MUST be set, and MUST
/// sign this transaction.<br/>
/// If the `admin_key` for the token is not set, this transaction SHALL
/// fail with a status code `TOKEN_IS_IMMUTABlE`.
