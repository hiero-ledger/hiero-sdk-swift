/// # Throttle Definitions
/// A set of messages that support maintaining throttling limits on network
/// transactions to ensure no one transaction type consumes the entirety of
/// network resources. Also used to charge congestion fees when network load
/// is exceptionally high, as an incentive to delay transactions that are
/// not time-sensitive.
///
/// For details behind this throttling design, please see the
/// `docs/throttle-design.md` document in the
/// [Hedera Services](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services) repository.
///
/// ### Keywords
/// The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
/// "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
/// document are to be interpreted as described in
/// [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
/// [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
