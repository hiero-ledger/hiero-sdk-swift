/// # Approve Allowance
/// This transaction body provides a mechanism to add "allowance" entries
/// for an account. These allowances enable one account to spend or transfer
/// token balances (for fungible/common tokens), individual tokens (for
/// non-fungible/unique tokens), or all non-fungible tokens owned by the
/// account, now or in the future (if `approved_for_all` is set).
///
/// ### Keywords
/// The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
/// "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
/// document are to be interpreted as described in
/// [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
/// [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
