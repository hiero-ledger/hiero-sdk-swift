# Issue Difficulty Overview — Hiero Swift SDK

## How to Use This Document

This page gives a simple overview of how issue labels are used in the  
Hiero Swift SDK repository.

It's here to help:

**Contributors:**
- Find issues that match their experience level  
- Understand what to expect from different types of tasks  
- Grow their skills over time  

**Maintainers:**
- Apply labels consistently  
- Set clear expectations for issue scope and readiness  
- Make the contribution experience smoother for everyone  

This isn't a rulebook, and it's not about limiting who can contribute.  
It's about helping people find the right starting point and build confidence along the way.

## Why We Use Issue Labels

The labeling system is designed to:

- Help contributors choose tasks that feel comfortable and achievable  
- Make expectations around scope and decision-making clearer  
- Support a natural progression from first PR to deeper ownership  
- Create a positive, trust-building contribution experience  

Everyone is welcome to contribute — labels simply help guide the journey.

## Readiness & Difficulty Labels

Each issue typically has:

- **One difficulty label** (Good First Issue, Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced)  
- An optional **readiness label** (Good First Issue: Candidate)  

Together, these give contributors a sense of both:
- How complex the task is  
- How ready it is for first-time contributors

### Readiness Label (Optional, Temporary)

| Label | What It Means |
|------|----------------|
| **Good First Issue: Candidate** | This issue might become a Good First Issue, but could use a little more clarity or polish first |

The candidate label is a friendly "almost ready" marker, giving maintainers time to refine the issue before promoting it.

### Difficulty Progression

| Level | Focus | What to Expect |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Good First Issue** | Getting started | Clear, step-by-step tasks |
| **Beginner** | Building confidence | Small, guided improvements |
| **Intermediate** | Growing ownership | Flexible, multi-file changes |
| **Advanced** | Shaping the system | Design-focused, high-impact work |

Each level reflects a gradual increase in:

- Independence  
- Context  
- Technical ownership

## How the Labels Work Together

- **Good First Issue: Candidate**  
  → Signals potential, not final readiness  

- **Good First Issue**  
  → Fully guided, step-by-step, and friendly for first-time contributors  

- **Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced**  
  → Indicate increasing levels of exploration, judgment, and ownership  

The goal is to make it easy for contributors to find issues that match their comfort level and grow from there.

## Choosing the Right Label

In general:

- Each issue has **one main difficulty label**  
- The candidate label is optional and temporary  
- If a task feels like it needs more clarity, it can stay in the candidate stage  
- If an issue feels more complex than expected, it's okay to choose a higher difficulty level  

Exploratory or open-ended issues usually work best with **Intermediate** or **Advanced** labels, where discussion and design are part of the process.

---

## From Candidate to Good First Issue

The candidate label exists to help maintainers prepare issues for new contributors.

Once an issue feels:

- Clear  
- Well-scoped  
- Easy to follow  
- And friendly for first-time contributors  

It can be promoted to a **Good First Issue**.

Taking a little extra time here helps create a smoother, more welcoming experience.

---

## The Big Picture

Issue labels exist to:

- Support contributors  
- Set clear expectations  
- Encourage steady skill growth  
- Build confidence over time  

**Accuracy matters more than volume**, because a great first experience is worth more than a long list of confusing issues.

Everyone is welcome — these labels just help people find the best place to begin.
