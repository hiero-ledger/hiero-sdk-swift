/// # Get Transaction Record
/// Messages for a query to obtain a transaction record. This particular
/// query is used by `getTxRecordByTxID` in the "Crypto" service API.
///
/// > Note
/// >> Much more detailed information for transaction records is available
/// >> from a mirror node, and the mirror node retains transaction records
/// >> long term, rather than for a short "cache" duration. Clients may
/// >> prefer the mirror node graph API to query transaction records, rather
/// >> than this query.
///
/// > Implementation Note
/// >> This query is _defined_ for "Crypto" service, but is _implemented_ by
/// >> the "Network Admin" service.
///
/// ### Keywords
/// The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
/// "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
/// document are to be interpreted as described in
/// [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
/// [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
