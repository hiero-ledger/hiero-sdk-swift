///*
/// # Get Transaction Receipt
/// This query is central to client interactions. A client must query
/// the network for the "receipt" after a transaction is submitted to know
/// whether the transaction succeeded and the consensus result.
///
/// > Implementation Note
/// >> This query is _defined_ for "Crypto" service, but is _implemented_ by
/// >> the "Network Admin" service.
///
/// > Note
/// >> The mechanism for transaction receipts and results is subject to
/// >> considerable change in the near future. Clients heavily dependent
/// >> on direct network queries for transaction receipts may consider
/// >> changes needed to query a mirror node for transaction receipts
/// >> and results instead.
